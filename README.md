# About me! ᯓ★

Hey there, I’m Sumaiyya. I’m an aspiring software engineer and UW Computer Science student with a passion for building meaningful projects. I focus on writing clean, effective code while also bringing creativity, curiosity, and collaboration to everything I do. Outside of coding, I’m invested in leadership and advocacy. I’ve led initiatives that empower communities, and I bring the same dedication to every project I work on. I enjoy tackling challenges, learning new skills, and creating solutions that make a difference!
